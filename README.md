# default-SEM-model
AxonDeepSeg default SEM model and testing image. This model works at a resolution of 0.1 micrometer per pixel and was trained on rat spinal cord data collected via a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

# Steps to train this model
1. Get ADS version: [[b05a40a]](https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/commit/b05a40aa03979a83313fe8704ee389672ed26ed7)
2. Get the data: https://osf.io/vrdpe/?action=download&version=1 (will soon be migrated to git-annex)
3. Run the notebook "guide_dataset_building.ipynb" to perform a split into training and validation set. 
4. Go to "training_guideline.ipynb" notebook and make necessary changes required in paths, URLâ€™s and config. Finally run all the cells of the notebook.
5. After successfully running all the cells, the trained model file will be saved under the directory: AxonDeepSeg/axondeepseg/models/
